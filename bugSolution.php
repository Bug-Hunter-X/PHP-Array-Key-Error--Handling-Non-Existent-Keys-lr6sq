The following code demonstrates a safer way to access array elements in PHP, preventing errors when keys might be missing.

```php
<?php
$myArray = ['a' => 1, 'b' => 2];

if (array_key_exists('c', $myArray)) {
    echo $myArray['c']; // Accessing the element only if the key exists
} else {
    echo 'Key "c" does not exist in the array.'; // Handle the case where the key is not found
}

//Alternative solution using the null coalescing operator (PHP 7.0 and above):
echo $myArray['c'] ?? 'Key "c" does not exist in the array.';
?>
```
This improved code checks for the existence of the key before accessing it, preventing unexpected errors and making the code more robust.
