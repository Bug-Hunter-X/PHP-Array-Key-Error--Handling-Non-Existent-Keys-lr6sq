This code snippet demonstrates a common PHP error related to improper handling of array keys.  The issue arises when attempting to access array elements using keys that may not exist, leading to unexpected behavior or errors. 

```php
<?php
$myArray = ['a' => 1, 'b' => 2];

echo $myArray['c']; // This will cause an error if key 'c' is not present.

//The solution is to check if the key exists before accessing it
if (array_key_exists('c', $myArray)) {
    echo $myArray['c'];
} else {
    echo 'Key does not exist';
}
?>
```
